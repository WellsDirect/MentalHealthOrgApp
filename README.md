# Update
I am currently working on developing a layout plan of the application as well as the information pertaining to the logistics of it. I am going to clear up what the application will do, how it will improve workflow and gather more information pertaining to keeping all patient information secured.

# First Info
Development of an Application for Mental Health Agencies to use in order to complete documents. Including, Intake, Assessments and gathering signatures. These can be forwarded from the application to a printer or email.

I am new to coding and such. I will appreciate any input into the development of this project. The goal is to have this project be available on many platforms, beginning with Android and iOS. What I am hoping to accomplish is to create a mobile EHR platform that will include such things as follows:

Therapy Notes Nurse Notes Aide Notes User Accounts Patient Account (For scheduling and questions) Physician Scheduling & Notes Calendar Appointment Reminders Medications of each patient Documents that need completed and signed (can be completed on a computer and signed on mobile) Billing and Invoicing

My initial start of this will be based on the Missouri Mental Health system but I would like for it to be expandable and editable for other states and governments as well.
